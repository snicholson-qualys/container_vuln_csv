# Image and Container Vulnerability CSV creation

This is an example script on creating two CSV files from the Qualys Container Security API for both images and containers respectively.

*Info* : Python script creates CSV files for vulnerability data from Qualys Cloud Security w.r.t details provided in `./config.yml`.
       Script debug info will be logged in ./debug/debug_file.txt

CSV File Info
*Vulnerability Image Report headers*
> Registry,Repository,ImageID,Tag,Hostname,Vulnerabiltiy ID,Severity,CVE Number,Published Date,Description,Patch Available

*Vulnerability Container Report headers*
>Registry,Repository,ImageID,Tag,Container,Hostname,Vulnerabiltiy ID,Severity,CVE Number,Published Date,Description,Patch Available

## Configuration
Two configuration settings will need to be made by the user before using this script: Updating the config.yml with appropriate information, and setting API username and password in environment variables.

*config.yml* provides script configuration information for vulnerability severity ratings and Qualys API URL

  `vulnerabilities_to_report`: string value of severity ratings to include (**acceptable entries 54321, 5432, 543, 54, or 5**)

  `apiURL`: Qualys API Gateway URL base (https:// - > .com, without a trailing '/'. e.g. `https://gateway.qg2.apps.qualys.com` )

  `pageSize`: Maximum number of records to return for container and image lists. Default value is 1000, maximum is 10000.

  `exitOnError`: Boolean. If set to *True* script will exit on failed API calls during script. If *False*, script will attempt to gracefully continue.

  `threadCount`: Thread count, used with --thread. Default value set to 4 - Acceptable Thread values for performance increase [2-8]

  `imageReportHeaders`: Set headers for Image Vuln CSV - Default List set to -- ['registry', 'repository', 'imageId', 'tag', 'hostname', 'severity', 'qid', 'firstFound', 'cveids', 'title', 'typeDetected', 'patchAvailable' ]

  `containerReportHeaders`: Set headers for Container Vuln CSV - Default List set to -- ['registry','registry', 'repository', 'imageId', 'containerId', 'name', 'hostname', 'ipAddress', 'qid', 'severity', 'cves', 'firstFound', 'title', 'typeDetected', 'patchAvailable']

### Qualys API Username and Password
This script is configured to read the Qualys User name and Password from OS Environment Variables:
  `QUALYS_API_USERNAME`: Qualys API Username

  `QUALYS_API_PASSWORD`: Qualys API Password

These can be set on a mac/linux system with commands such as:
```
export QUALYS_API_USERNAME=frank
export QUALYS_API_PASSWORD=frankspassword
```

The Script is configured to read in a base64 encoded password via a base64.decode

*note*: We recommend you consider ramifications of leaving credentials in environment variables or shell history. Potential improvements to this script would include reading these credentials from more secure locations.

## Script Requirements
This script is tested on Python 3.

This script requires the following PIP modules to run:
  requests, PyYAML

These modules can be installed with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may wish to use a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) as to not pollute your host system.


# Logging

## Running the script

View command line options for running script.
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py --help

No threading, serialized iterations, no software package details
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py

Threading, async processing of list iteration for singular calls to Qualys API for images and containers lists. Must configure ./config.yml['defaults']['threads'] for 2 to 8 threads, default value is 4
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py --thread

Create report with one row per vulnerable software package per image/container instead of one row per CVE.
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py --software

Create report for images with an updated timestamp greater than the specified value, must be used with --imagesonly or -i.
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py --updated epochTimeStamp

Record progress of max images updated tiem stamp and store in Last_Updated_Result, next run of will return image updated greater than the stored value, must be used with --imagesonly or -i.
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py --recordprogress

Create report with only image information, the containers report will be skipped.
>> python3 container_vuln_csv.py --imagesonly
